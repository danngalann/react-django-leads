# Lead Manager App with React and Django
Fullstack lead manager app made with Django and React. This project is based on a [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbRA-CIUxlxkUpbq0IFkX60) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb), fixing some issues and updating the frontend.

## What I've learned
### Django
* Setting routes between multiple apps
* Setting up RESTful API
* Backend authentication
### React
* Implementing React inside a Django project
* Using Redux
* Frontend autentication
* Connecting with an API
### Deployment
During the deployment of this project in [pythonanywhere.com](pythonanywhere.com), I've 
* Managed python virtualenvs
* Updated Django configs to allow access to the new URL (this took me a while to figure out)
* Set up new static routes and WSGI
